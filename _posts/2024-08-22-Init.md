# First post of my blog (ChatGPT)

This blog serves as a record of my projects and studies. Lately, I’ve felt the need for a platform to showcase what I’ve accomplished. I’ve worked on several personal projects related to robotics, statistics, and deep learning. These projects have varied in purpose; some began from a simple curiosity, while others align with my broader goal of becoming an engineer in the dental industry. I believe that creating an autonomous robot capable of performing procedures without human oversight could bring tremendous value to people.

To achieve this goal, I’ve identified several key skills I need to develop. The first is English. Much of the cutting-edge technology is documented in English, making it essential for me to be proficient in the language. Although English is not my native language and I am a student living in South Korea, I am confident that I can attain a level of English proficiency suitable for business.

This blog will feature both raw versions of my writing and edited versions, revised with the help of language models or grammar tools. I hope that tracking the evolution of my writing over time will be interesting for readers, as I anticipate rapid improvement.

Another goal of mine is to deepen my understanding of statistics. I view statistics as a powerful framework for analyzing and interpreting the world, offering clarity and insights that can guide decision-making. While deep learning has gained prominence recently, statistics remains valuable for explainable analysis and informed choices.

In addition to posts on statistics, I plan to cover topics related to robotics, biology, computation, and other areas of interest. I look forward to engaging with a global audience and sharing knowledge with people around the world.


# First post of my blog (Raw)

This is my blog for record my projects or which I studied.
These days, I feel that I need some place to show what I did.
I did several projects personally.
These were about robotics, statistics, or deep learning.
The purpose of these projects were various.
Some projects was started by small interest.
And other projects was related with my dream.
My dream is to be an engineer in dental industry.
I think making an autonomous robot which does procedure without management by human could make enormous value for people.

For this, I picked some ability which I need for this dream.
First one was English.
Almost of technology near by a frontier is written by English.
So, Learning English is nessesary for this dream.
Unfortunately, I'm just an student living in South Korea.
English is not my native language but I trust ownself that I could achieve enough ability of English for Business.

This is why I selected English for this blog.
For readers, I'll upload raw version of my writing and edited version by some llm or grammar service.
Watching my writings in long term could be interesting for you.
Because I think my writing will develop rapid.

Another thing what I want to achieve is statistical knowledge.
I think statistics is one kind of framework to see the world in high resolution.
Statistics can make our problem clear or gives us some clue for decision.
Although deep learning arised in recent few years, for explainable analysis, statistics is still useful for wise decision.

I'll post not only about statistics, but robotics, biology, computation, etc could be uploaded by just my interest.

I wonder to communicate with a lot of people around the world.
